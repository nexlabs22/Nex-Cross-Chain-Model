## Overview

The Nex Cross-Chain Model is designed to:

- Facilitate secure and trustless asset transfers across different blockchain networks.
- Support interoperability for decentralized applications.
- Leverage advanced cryptographic techniques and oracles to ensure data integrity and security.

## Features

- **Multi-Chain Support**: Compatible with major blockchains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon.
- **Security**: Utilizes cryptographic proofs and decentralized oracles for trustless communication.
- **Scalability**: Designed for high throughput and low-latency cross-chain operations.
- **Extensibility**: Easily integrate additional chains and functionalities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/): A toolkit for Ethereum development.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (optional, for auxiliary tools).
- Access to RPC URLs for the blockchains you want to test with.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nexlabs22/Nex-Cross-Chain-Model.git
   cd Nex-Cross-Chain-Model
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   forge install
   ```
3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   forge build
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with the following:

   ```env
   RPC_URL_MAINNET=<Your Mainnet RPC URL>
   RPC_URL_TESTNET=<Your Testnet RPC URL>
   PRIVATE_KEY=<Your Wallet Private Key>
   ```
2. Update configuration files if needed to match your blockchain network setup.

## Usage

Deploy the contracts to your desired network:

```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> --broadcast
```

Integrate the cross-chain functionality into your dApp by importing and utilizing the deployed contracts.

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
forge test
```

Use the `-vvv` flag for verbose output:

```bash
forge test -vvv
```

### Test Environment

The test cases simulate cross-chain scenarios using mock oracles and relayers. Ensure your `.env` file contains the necessary configuration for testing.
